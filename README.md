## About The Project

Microservice in charge of providing an endpoint rest to obtain the rate and price to be applied to a product.

If two rates coincide in a date range, the one with the higher priority (higher numerical value) is applied.

### Input parameters

- brand identifier
- product identifier
- application date

#### Example

http://localhost:8080/api/v1.0/prices?brandId=1&productId=35455&date=2020-06-14-12.20.42

### Output parameters

- brand identifier
- product identifier
- start application date
- end application date
- rate
- price
- currency

The currency attribute has been added to the answer. It complements the price attribute and depending on the country
this value could change.
The previous name curr has been updated to currency because it is a more specific name.

In addition, the original price_list attribute has been changed to rate because it is a more specific name.

#### Example

```json
{
   "brandId": 1,
   "startDate": "2020-06-14T00:00:00",
   "endDate": "2020-12-31T23:59:59",
   "rate": 1,
   "productId": "35455",
   "price": 35.5,
   "currency": "EUR"
}
```

## Architecture

A three-layer architecture has been used. This architecture is a commonly used approach in software development to
separate responsibilities and organise code in a modular and maintainable way.

The Controller layer, is solely responsible for exposing the functionality so that it can be consumed by external
entities. The Repository layer, is responsible for storing and retrieving some set of data. The Service layer is where
all the business logic should go.

This architecture promotes separation of concerns and facilitates modularity, code reuse and maintainability. In
addition, it supports the principle of dependency inversion.
